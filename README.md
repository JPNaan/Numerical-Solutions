This Numerical Solutions Project is a collection of python functions to perform various numerical solutions.

NumericalSolutions_PolyZeros.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook containing the functions to perform the following Methods of finding zeros to the polynomial:
 -- Bisection Methods
 -- Fixed Point Iteration (FPI)
 -- Newton's Method
 -- Secant Method

 There is also a section of this Notebook containing sample questions and verification.
